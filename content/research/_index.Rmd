### The Effect of Fraternity Moratoriums on Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assaults

*Abstract*: 
Over 800 universities in the United States have fraternities. While there are positive effects of membership such as increased graduation rates and higher future income, fraternities are also a source of alcohol and partying for students. In this paper, I exploit the variation in timing from 44 temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity with alcohol (henceforth, *moratoriums*) across 37 universities over a six-year period (2014-2019). I construct a novel data set, merging unique incident-level crime logs from university police departments to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of moratoriums on campus-wide reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assaults. In particular, I find strong and robust evidence that fraternity moratoriums decrease alcohol offenses campus-wide by 26%. This effect is driven by decreases in weekend reports, consistent with the timing of most college partying. Additionally, I find suggestive evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends by 29%. However, while moratoriums clearly impact student behavior when implemented, I do not find evidence of long-term changes once the moratorium is lifted.
