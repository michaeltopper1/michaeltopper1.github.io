### The Effects of Fraternity Moratoriums on Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assaults

*Abstract*: 
Fraternities maintain a presence at over 800 universities in the United States. While there are positive effects of membership such as increased graduation rates and future income, fraternities are also a reliable source of alcohol and partying for underage students in addition to their members exhibiting more binge drinking behavior than their non-member peers. In this paper, I exploit the variation in timing from 45 temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity with alcohol (moratoriums) across 38 universities over a six-year period (2014-2019). I construct a novel data set, merging unique incidence-level crime logs from university police departments to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of moratoriums on campus-wide reports of alcohol and sexual assault offenses. In particular, I find strong and robust evidence that fraternity moratoriums decrease alcohol violations campus-wide by 27%. This effect is driven by decreases in weekend reports, consistent with the timing of most college partying.  Additionally, I find weaker evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends. However, both of these effects are transient, with moratoriums showing no evidence of long-run changes in student behavior.
