### The Effect of Fraternity Moratoriums on Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assaults

*Abstract*: 
I exploit variation in timing from 44 temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity with alcohol (*moratoriums*) across 37 universities over 2014-2019. I construct a novel data set, merging incident-level crime logs from university police departments to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of moratoriums on reports of alcohol offenses and sexual assaults. In particular, I find robust evidence that moratoriums decrease alcohol offenses by 26%. Additionally, I find suggestive evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends by 29%. However, I do not find evidence of long-term changes once the moratorium is lifted.

### The Effect of ShotSpotter Technology on Police Response Times (with Toshio Ferrazares)

**Job Market Paper**

*Abstract:*
ShotSpotter is an acoustic gunfire detection technology utilized by police departments in over 150 cities world-wide with the intention of rapidly dispatching police officers to violent crime scenes in effort to reduce gun violence. In Chicago, this amounts to approximately 60 instances per-day whereby officers are rapidly dispatched to hypothesized sounds of gunfire. However, this allocation diverts police resources away from confirmed reports of 911 emergencies, creating delays in rapid responseâ€”a critical component of policing with health and safety implications. In this paper, we utilize variation in timing from ShotSpotter rollouts across Chicago police districts from 2016-2022 to estimate the causal effects of ShotSpotter on 911 emergency response times that are designated as Priority 1 (immediate dispatch). Using comprehensive 911 dispatch data from the Chicago Police Department, we find that ShotSpotter implementation causes police officers to be dispatched one-minute slower (23\% increase) and arrive on-scene nearly two-minutes later (13\% increase). Moreover, these effects are driven by periods with fewer police on-duty and higher numbers of ShotSpotter-related dispatches. Consequently, police officers' success rate in arresting perpetrators decreases by approximately 8\% when responding to emergency calls, with notably large decreases in domestic battery (15\%). However, we also find suggestive evidence that ShotSpotter decreases the probability of a victim injury, particularly for gun-related reports, thereby indicating success in achieving its primary goal, albeit at a significant cost.
