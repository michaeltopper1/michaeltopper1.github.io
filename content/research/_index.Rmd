### Hold Their Beers? The Effects of Fraternity Moratoriums on Crime

*Abstract*: 
Fraternities maintain a presence at over 800 universities in the United States. While the literature has documented positive effects of membership such as increased gradua- tion rates and future income, studies have also shown fraternities to be a reliable source of alcohol for underage students in addition to their members exhibiting more partying behavior than their non-member peers. In this paper, I exploit the variation in timing from 45 temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity with alcohol (moratoriums) across 38 universities over a six-year period (2014-2019). I construct a novel data set, merging unique incidence-level crime logs from university police departments to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of moratoriums on campus-wide reports of alcohol, drug, and sexual assault offenses. In particular, I find strong and robust evidence that fraternity moratoriums lower alcohol violations campus-wide by 27%. This effect is driven by decreases in weekend reports, consistent with the timing of most fraternity parties. Additionally, I find weaker evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends. However, both these effects are transient, with moratoriums showing no evidence of long-run changes in student behavior.
