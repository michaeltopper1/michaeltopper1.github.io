<h3>The Effects of Fraternity Moratoriums on Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assaults</h3>
<p><em>Abstract</em>:
Fraternities maintain a presence at over 800 universities in the United States. While there are positive effects of membership such as increased graduation rates and future income, fraternities are also a reliable source of alcohol and partying for underage students. In this paper, I exploit the variation in timing from 44 temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity with alcohol (moratoriums) across 37 universities over a six-year period (2014-2019). I construct a novel data set, merging unique incidence-level crime logs from university police departments to provide the first causal estimates of the effect of moratoriums on campus-wide reports of alcohol and sexual assault offenses. In particular, I find strong and robust evidence that fraternity moratoriums decrease alcohol violations campus-wide by 26%. This effect is driven by decreases in weekend reports, consistent with the timing of most college partying. Additionally, I find suggestive evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends. However, while moratoriums clearly impact student behavior when implemented, I do not find evidence of long-term changes once the moratorium is lifted.</p>
