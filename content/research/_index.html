<h3>Cage the Alpha-Male? How Fraternity Moratoriums Affect Alcohol Offenses and Sexual Assault</h3>
<p><em>Abstract</em>: Fraternities remain a ubiquitous, and longstanding tradition across the US with chapters maintaining a presence at over 800 universities and some existing since the mid-1800s. While previous literature has linked fraternity membership to positive outcomes such as higher income, increased philanthropy, and GPA, it has also been shown to represent high rates of alcohol abuse, increased partying, and toxic masculinity. In this paper, I exploit the plausibly exogenous variation from temporary university-wide halts on all fraternity activity (moratoriums) across 38 universities. Using a novel data set collected through webscraping, pdf extracting, and Freedom of Information Act requests, I present the first causal evidence of what could happen across university campuses if fraternities were prohibited from serving alcohol at social events and faced stricter regulations. In particular, I find strong, statistically significant, and robust evidence that fraternity moratoriums lower alcohol violations campus-wide by 25%. These effects are driven by large decreases on the weekends rather than weekdays and when a university enforces the moratorium rather than the fraternity members themselves. Moreover, I find weak evidence that moratoriums decrease reports of sexual assault on the weekends and when moratoriums are triggered by sexual assault allegations.</p>
