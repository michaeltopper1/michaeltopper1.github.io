<p>Do you like Melon? Me too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/theneedledrop">Anthony Fantano</a> does a great job reviewing music, although his preferences seem to be a little sporadic at times.</p>
<p>Now what if I told you that you could download a csv file of all his ratings and quantify his preferences? Well, now you can. You can either go to my Github account and find it under <code>webscraping/fantano/xxmaster_data.csv</code>, or you can download it <a href="xxmaster_data.csv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The data is scraped from <a href="albumoftheyear.org">albumoftheyear.org</a>. Below are a couple of graphs I produced with the data:</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:unnamed-chunk-2"></span>
