<p>As a pseudo-productive way to procrastinate my research production, I decided to take a day to learn more about <code>plotly</code> and <code>ggplot2</code>. using these tools together, I managed to create a fun visualization of the internet’s busiest nerd. Unfortunately, I can’t seem to understand how to change the width of blog post pages…so look out for updates to see the graph with a better width.</p>
