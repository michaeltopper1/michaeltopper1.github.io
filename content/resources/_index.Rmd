# Learning R

These are my favorite resources for learning R. I *highly* recommend you learn the `tidyverse` if you plan on data wrangling. It is the most intuitive and clean syntax I have seen for cleaning/analyzing data.

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) : Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund's invaluable text. This is the best place to learn R. I recently discovered that reading chapters of material I *thought* I had an exceptional grasp on provided me with workflow and best practice tips. I cannot recommend this book enough. Read it cover to cover and bookmark it.

-   [Grant McDermott's Data Science for Economists Lecture Notes](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures): These are quite simply the best online notes on data science for economists I have ever seen. Unsure what an API is? Wondering how to [correct your standard errors](https://grantmcdermott.com/better-way-adjust-SEs/)? Grant's lecture notes (and blog) have it all, with code, free to access.

-   [David Robinson's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ): Every week, David Robinson (author of the `broom` and `tidytext` packages) takes a new data set, and livestreams himself analyzing it. This is an exceptionally good resource for getting comfortable with the `ggplot2` syntax and learning what graphs work with which data. Plus, it's entertaining!

-   [R for STATA Users](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/manipulate-data.html): This provides translations of common code from R to STATA and vice-versa.



# Tools for Research

### Zotero

This is my favorite way of tracking journal articles for literature reviews. It is completely free, and has an incredible Chrome extension for quickly saving journal articles/web pages into a folder. As a bonus: it can easily create bibtex files with a click of the button and it integrates with RStudio's new Rmarkdown interactive editor. [Learn more here.](https://www.zotero.org/)

### Freedom of Information Act

The Freedom of Information Act is an excellent resource for getting data. It states that federal institutions are required to give you documents that exist (with some exceptions) within a certain amount of time. I have frequently used this method to receive police department data. Here are some of my favorite resources to get you started with using this tool:

-   [Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com/): a non-profit news site that provides a repository of thousands of pages of FOIA'd information. See what documents/data researchers and journalists are currently seeking.

-   [National Freedom of Information Coalition Sample FOIA Letters](https://www.nfoic.org/state-sample-foia-request-letters/): templates for FOIA requests. Since FOIA laws vary by state, this is a particularly useful resource when your analysis requires you to gather data from multiple states.
