<h1>Learning R</h1>
<p>These are my favorite resources for learning R. I <em>highly</em> recommend you learn the <code>tidyverse</code> if you plan on data wrangling. It is the most intuitive and clean syntax I have seen for cleaning/analyzing data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> : Hadley Wickham &amp; Garret Grolemund’s invaluable text. This is the best place to learn R. I recently discovered that reading chapters of material I <em>thought</em> I had an exceptional grasp on provided me with workflow and best practice tips. I cannot recommend this book enough. Read it cover to cover and bookmark it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures">Grant McDermott’s Data Science for Economists Lecture Notes</a>: These are quite simply the best online notes on data science for economists I have ever seen. Unsure what an API is? Wondering how to <a href="https://grantmcdermott.com/better-way-adjust-SEs/">correct your standard errors</a>? Grant’s lecture notes (and blog) have it all, with code, free to access.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ">David Robinson’s YouTube Channel</a>: Every week, David Robinson (author of the <code>broom</code> and <code>tidytext</code> packages) takes a new data set, and livestreams himself analyzing it. This is an exceptionally good resource for getting comfortable with the <code>ggplot2</code> syntax and learning what graphs work with which data. Plus, it’s entertaining!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/manipulate-data.html">R for STATA Users</a>: This provides translations of common code from R to STATA and vice-versa.</p></li>

<div id="zotero" class="section level3">
<h3>Zotero</h3>
<p>This is my favorite way of tracking journal articles for literature reviews. It is completely free, and has an incredible Chrome extension for quickly saving journal articles/web pages into a folder. As a bonus: it can easily create bibtex files with a click of the button and it integrates with RStudio’s new Rmarkdown interactive editor. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Learn more here.</a></p>

<div id="freedom-of-information-act" class="section level3">
<h3>Freedom of Information Act</h3>
<p>The Freedom of Information Act is an excellent resource for getting data. It states that federal institutions are required to give you documents that exist (with some exceptions) within a certain amount of time. I have frequently used this method to receive police department data. Here are some of my favorite resources to get you started with using this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.muckrock.com/">Muckrock</a>: a non-profit news site that provides a repository of thousands of pages of FOIA’d information. See what documents/data researchers and journalists are currently seeking.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nfoic.org/state-sample-foia-request-letters/">National Freedom of Information Coalition Sample FOIA Letters</a>: templates for FOIA requests. Since FOIA laws vary by state, this is a particularly useful resource when your analysis requires you to gather data from multiple states.</p></li>
